# Daily-Scheduler
Project is a Daily Scheduler website deployment, where the user can input tasks into the appropriate "description of task" column, and hit the save button to save the task. Rows are assorted by hour of the day from 9am to 5pm (a typical work day). Rows are also color coded by whether the hour is the current one (red), past hour (gray), or a upcoming hour (green). Before midnight after 5pm, all rows should be coded gray "in the past", and after midnight before 9am all should be coded green for "upcoming hours". Saved tasks will also be saved into the local storage, so that the user can still refresh the page and have their tasks they had saved rendered onto the screen. Current date is also displayed toward the top of the page within the header.
